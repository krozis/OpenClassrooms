		<p>On a dark desert highway <br>
			Cool wind in my hair <br>
			Warm smell of colitas <br>
			Rising up through the air <br>
			Up ahead in the distance <br>
			I saw a shimmering light <br>
			My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim <br>
			I had to stop for the night</p>
		<p>
			There she stood in the doorway <br>
			I heard the mission bell <br>
			And I was thinkin' to myself <br>
			"This could be heaven or this could be hell" <br>
			Then she lit up a candle <br>
			And she showed me the way <br>
			There were voices down the corridor <br>
			I thought I heard them say
		</p>
		<p class="container text-primary bg-light chorus py-4">
			"Welcome to the Hotel California <br>
			Such a lovely place (such a lovely place) <br>
			Such a lovely face <br>
			Plenty of room at the Hotel California <br>
			Any time of year (any time of year) <br>
			You can find it here"
		</p>
		<p>
			Her mind is Tiffany-twisted <br>
			She got the Mercedes-Benz, uh <br>
			She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys <br>
			That she calls friends <br>
			How they dance in the courtyard <br>
			Sweet summer sweat <br>
			Some dance to remember <br>
			Some dance to forget
		</p>
		<p>
			So I called up the Captain <br>
			"Please bring me my wine" <br>
			He said, "We haven't had that spirit here <br>
			Since 1969" <br>
			And still, those voices are calling <br>
			From far away <br>
			Wake you up in the middle of the night <br>
			Just to hear them say <br>
		</p>
		<p class="container text-primary bg-light chorus py-4">
			"Welcome to the Hotel California <br>
			Such a lovely place (such a lovely place) <br>
			Such a lovely face <br>
			They're livin' it up at the Hotel California <br>
			What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise) <br>
			Bring your alibis"
		</p>
		<p>
			Mirrors on the ceiling <br>
			The pink champagne on ice <br>
			And she said, "We are all just prisoners here <br>
			Of our own device" <br>
			And in the master's chambers <br>
			They gathered for the feast <br>
			They stab it with their steely knives <br>
			But they just can't kill the beast
		</p>
		<p>
			Last thing I remember <br>
			I was running for the door <br>
			I had to find the passage back <br>
			To the place I was before <br>
			"Relax, " said the night man <br>
			"We are programmed to receive <br>
			You can check out any time you like <br>
			But you can never leave!"
